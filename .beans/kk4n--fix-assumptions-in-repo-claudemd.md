The CLAUDE.md created for this repo contains unverified assumptions that need to be fixed.

## Assumptions to verify/correct

- 'symlinked to ~/.claude/' - need to verify if global/ is actually symlinked
- 'Custom statusline implementation' - didn't read the file to confirm what it does
- 'Claude Code workflow optimizations' - invented focus area, not confirmed with Jon
- Conventions section - made up without asking what the actual conventions are

## Action

Ask Jon for the correct information and update the file accordingly.
