Tracking patterns where Claude Code doesn't work as expected or reliably follow instructions.

## Child issues

- Ignores explicit CLAUDE.md rules (63rk)
- Uses wrong tools despite system instructions (l7na)
- Research instruction-following failures (3fvz)

## Impact

These issues make Claude Code less predictable and harder to work with. Explicit instructions aren't followed reliably, requiring constant correction.
