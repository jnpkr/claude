Understand how Claude's internal decision-making works regarding modes of operation (helpful, autonomous, asking for clarification) and how to align with those systems rather than replace them.

## Questions to explore

- How does Claude internally decide between different modes of operation?
- What existing conventions/systems govern this behavior?
- How can CLAUDE.md instructions work with (not against) these systems?
- What does Anthropic's documentation say about this?
- How is the current configuration (skills, plugins, CLAUDE.md files) improving or conflicting with these internal systems?

## Checklist

- [ ] Research Claude's documented behavior around autonomy and clarification
- [ ] Understand existing internal systems before trying to modify them
- [ ] Audit current configuration (skills, plugins, CLAUDE.md) for conflicts
- [ ] Identify alignment opportunities rather than replacement approaches
