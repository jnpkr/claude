Comprehensive research into why Claude Code doesn't reliably follow explicit instructions.

## Questions to investigate

- Why explicit instructions don't reliably translate into behavior
- Whether basic reasoning failures (incorrect categorization, not thinking before acting) are fixable or fundamental
- Whether this is a Claude Code issue, model issue, or prompt engineering issue
- What mitigations exist (prompt patterns, settings, workarounds)
- How others in the Claude Code community are handling this

## Approach

- Review Claude Code documentation and known issues
- Search community forums/GitHub issues for similar reports
- Experiment with different prompt patterns
- Document findings and potential mitigations
