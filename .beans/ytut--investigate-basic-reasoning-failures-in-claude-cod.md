Research whether basic reasoning failures (incorrect categorization, not thinking before acting, lumping unrelated things together) are fixable through prompt engineering or fundamental model limitations.

## Context
This may be an underlying cause of other issues like rule-ignoring (63rk) and wrong tool use (l7na).

## Questions to answer
- Are these failures consistent or sporadic?
- Do specific prompt patterns reduce them?
- Is this documented in Claude/Claude Code literature?
- What workarounds exist?
